The progam that I have made is a hangman game application. To play the game the user must try and guess a letter of the blank word provided, the user has about 7 incorrect entries until the word is revealed to the user. For every letter that the user guesses correctly the letter will appear in the correct indexes. The user will also get a chance to guess the whole word, when either the user guesses the correct word or guesses each letter correctly the hangman word will appear.
